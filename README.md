# Classification of Species' Habitats 
Classification of Species' habitats using the BOLD eDNA data and Nucleotide sequencing

This project was part of the [Gainforest](gainforest.earth) AI+ Environment [EcoHackathon](https://gainforest.notion.site/AI-Environment-Hackathon-2024-Wiki-27f7f5459ea743b2bec1b9b11af54ef4), where my team, #SpaceM worked on the eDNA BOLD dataset to develop a habitats classification model, using nucleotide sequencing. Our solution involved understanding the relationships between species, their nucleotide sequences, and how such information could be leveraged in classifying them into respective habitats.

Although still having lots of room for improvement, this project is particularly essential in consolidating existing efforts in areas of application of ML in better understanding eDNA sequencing and alignment for ecological interventions. We are really excited about the many possibilities this holds and its overall impacts on nature and biodiversity conservation efforts.
